**To Be Dones:**  
In order to prepare a launchable phone app, separate the server code from the client side code  
Implement geolocation (https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova_geolocation_geolocation.md.html)  
Beautify the UI (pictures take up whole empty area on screen, allow pictures to move with the swipe)  
Build functionality for "Give me random!"  
Show only pictures that were previously unseen  

**Other Ideas:**  
Allow users to upload images  
Allow multiple pictures per restaurant  
Accrue stats on likes/dislikes for each image and allow people to see stats
